#	Our Mission

Caroline Academy is a specialist in international educational tour operator for families, schools & youth groups. Everyone at Caroline Academy is passionate about educational travel and could give you an overflowing list of reasons why students and families should pursue it. 

- There are many reasons why Caroline Academy stands out above other consultancies. Firstly, we support our students with every aspect of the application. Our students get a team of experts who focus on each area of the application process. Each student is paired with an expert Strategist who oversees their application and helps them create a list of safety, target and reach schools. Secondly, we provide our students with a range of unique out-of-classroom opportunities — Extracurricular Support Program that gives more opportunities for our students to experience real life in the target schools, which truly help applicants make smart choice for their future study. 
- We help families, schools, colleges, and youth groups with well-designed educational tours to destinations throughout the world, such as Europe, Africa and North America, and we’re ready and waiting to work with you once again. Without any worries, our students will enjoy their personalized courses as soon as the educational tour starts, travelling while learning. Our educational tour is composed of three sections: before traveling, while traveling and after traveling. The all-around assessment and evaluation activities will definitely help our students improve their learning, knowledge, proficiency or success and provide parents or families with critical information about their children’s development. 
- We are committed to Holistic Education, which emphasizes the development of the whole person—intellectually, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. This approach sees children as individuals with unique needs and talents and recognizes that children learn best when their individual needs are met. Holistic education is a comprehensive approach to teaching where we seek to address the emotional, social, ethical, and academic needs of students in an integrated learning format. Emphasis is placed on positive learning environments and providing whole-child supports (services that support academic and nonacademic needs, also known as wraparound supports) to students. 
- Our students are taught to reflect on their actions and how they impact the global and local community, as well as how to learn from the community around them. Teachers often engage students in projects that apply critical-thinking skills toward solving real-world problems.
- We have a wide range of ready-made itineraries that ensure you benefit from our experience, and we’re always happy to help you tailor-make a school trip specifically to suit you.
- Search the site by Destination or Subject, or take a look at some of our most popular extracurricular activities, including educational and academic clubs and educational tours, including Study in UK and Study in Switzerland for Primary Schools and Secondary Schools, as well as a great selection of Day-Trips.
- We will do our very best to give you the very best value, always!
